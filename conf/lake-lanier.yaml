  # Sampling effect

  # 2 10L carboys.

  ##
  # Extraction effect
  # 
  # A typical bacterial cell contains between 2 and 3 fg of DNA (see
  # Christensen, Olsen, and Bakken, 1995, Microb Ecol 29:49-62), so I'm assuming
  # and average of 2.5 fg/cell (or 2.9e-9 ug/cell). The cell counts of Lake
  # Lanier have an average of 9.02e5 cells in 750 ul, or 1.2e9 cells/l. Finally,
  # the total DNA yield of the extraction, measured with qubit after cleaning,
  # is on average 1.7 ug/l filtered. This results in an efficiency of ~60%.
  # = (1.7) / (2.5e-9 * 1.2e9)
  extraction_effect: 0.5667

  ##
  # Library effect
  # 
  # Assuming a total sampled volume of 20 l (see "Sampling effect" above) and an
  # extraction yield of 1.7 ug/l (see "Extraction effect" above), one would
  # expect a total of 34 ug of DNA extracted per sample (on average). The
  # sequencing libraries prepared in this project typically use a total of 1 ng
  # (adjusting concentration). Libraries undergo 12-14 rounds of PCR, which
  # should result in a total of around 8 ug from the input 1ng. This is, a 50
  # ul stock at 2-4 nM DNA (0.1-0.2 pmol DNA), from which 5 ul (10-20 fmol DNA)
  # are diluted into 1ml at 10 pM DNA.
  # = (1e-9 / 34e-6) * (10e-15 / 0.1e-12)
  library_effect: 2.941176e-06

  ##
  # Sequencing effect
  # 
  # 10 fmol loaded correspond to 6 billion molecules. On average, the sequenced
  # datasets result in 19 million pairs of reads.
  # = 1.85574e7 / 6e9
  sequencing_effect: 0.0030929

  ##
  # Annotation effect
  # 
  # From the average 19 million pairs of reads sequenced, an average of 13
  # million reads pass the QC steps, with around 10% reduction on average read
  # length.
